# We_learn
Project Title: WeLearn LMS

Description: WeLearn is an LMS solution for viewing and tracking content offline using APIs to validate students and allow them to download content onto their devices. The course content is available offline and the LMS tracks data and sends it to a Learning Record Storage whenever the learners are connected to the internet.

Tools that will be used to implement WeLearn

Reactjs (Front-end)

Reactjs is an ideal front-end library for developing our project because it will help us build rich user-interfaces easily and optimise the user experience from the get-go. It will also ease our workload and increase our productivity with its vast library of reusable components and development tools.

PHP (Back-end)

PHP is the fastest way to get our web app- WeLearn up and running. We will use it to run background server-side services and modify files on the server faster. PHP also does not come with compatibility issues and will make it easy for testing with different devices and browsers. Among many other advantages PHP has over other languages like Java it is our choice for this assignment.

MySQL (Database) 

We chose MySQL because of its ability to query data with utmost efficiency. SQL is also ideal for scaling which means it can work for our small project and has the potential to stick around if WeLearn becomes a big application. It is also very popular and easy to use.
